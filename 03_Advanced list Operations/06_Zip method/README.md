## 1. Introduction 📘  

This example demonstrates how to combine two lists into a single **list of tuples** using the built-in `zip()` function. Each tuple contains one element from each of the two lists, matched by their index positions. 🎯✨  

---

## 2. Steps to Zip Two Lists 🚀  

1. **Define the Two Lists 📋**:  
   - Create two separate lists, `list1` and `list2`, containing elements to pair.  

2. **Use the `zip()` Function 🔗**:  
   - Combine the two lists into pairs using `zip(list1, list2)`.  

3. **Convert to a List 🧾**:  
   - Since `zip()` returns an iterator, use `list()` to convert it into a list of tuples.  

4. **Print the Result 🖨️**:  
   - Display the list of tuples created by pairing elements from both lists.  

---

## 3. Key Points 🌟  

- **Pairing Elements ✨**:  
  - The `zip()` function pairs elements at the same index from both lists.  

- **Unequal Lengths ⚠️**:  
  - If the lists have different lengths, the resulting list will only include as many pairs as the shorter list.  

- **Tuples in the Result 📦**:  
  - Each pair is represented as a tuple `(element_from_list1, element_from_list2)`.  

---

## 4. Output Explanation 🔍  

- **Input Lists 📋**:  
  - `list1 = [1, 2, 3]`  
  - `list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']`  

- **Zipping Process 🤝**:  
  - Index 0: `(1, 'a')`  
  - Index 1: `(2, 'b')`  
  - Index 2: `(3, 'c')`  

- **Final Output ✅**:  
  - The combined list of tuples is: `[(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]`.  

---

## 5. Example Code 💻  
```python
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
zipped_list = list(zip(list1, list2))
print(zipped_list)  # Output: [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
